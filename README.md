# Tax Return

Better tools for filling out form 1040 & friends for 2018 US taxes.

# Prerequisites

`make`: Probably already installed, otherwise run something like `brew install make` or `apt-get install make`

`python` & `pip`: Probably already installed, otherwise checkout [installation instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

`pdftk`: See [installation instructions](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/). The standard installation is broken on Mac, use [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39814799) instead.

# Building your taxes

Run `make example` to generate John Doe's example tax returns (using input data from `input/examples`).

Make a copy of the example data to your own `personal-data` folder (`cp -r examples personal-data`) and edit the input to suit your situation. Then run `make` and check out your tax return pdf files in the `build` folder.

I am not even remotely qualified to be doing this.

This code likely has bugs and if you put your faith in it, the IRS will likely have some problems w you.

Those are not my problems, use these tools at your own risk. Do your own research.
